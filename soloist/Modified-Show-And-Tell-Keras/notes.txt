There are approx. 12000 duplicate captions
If we take a list of all captions and then the set of that list:
 - all caps: 365_193
 - set all caps: 353_344

TODO:

-  in evaluate.py plot the betas as a line (mayeb only every 100th datapoint) also show the caption and NSD key. Make sure that the betas are unique for every trial.

    Current issue is that the evaluation shows the same caption for every image for the betas at the moment. (Images is working).
