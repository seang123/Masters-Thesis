# Masters Thesis
## Think and Tell - image captioning from brain data

---

# Plan

1. Implement the CNN-RNN architecture from the "Show and Tell" paper, download the pre-trained weights so save time if possible.
 - test it on the mscoc dataset
 - convert it to work with the fMRI data
2. Add an attention mechanism
3. Use a transformer network
